GitHub Guides - Hello World Tutorial

Hi Everyone!

I'm Frank, I like to experiment with different languages and frameworks and enjoy researching new technology.
Otherwise, I always enjoy solving different everyday problems and making tedious/repetitive tasks easier with coding/scripting/automating...etc.

If not around technology, I can be found sipping on Bubble Tea, exploring new places for photography and seeking new adventures.

That's me in a nutshell! :)
